# About the Mudawwana App
The app is created with PowerBI for exploring and analysing text reuse data of the _Mudawwana_ of Saḥnūn b. Saʿīd (d. 856) and the OpenITI corpus prepared by KITAB. Text reuse refers to shared passages in the _Mudawwana_ and other works in  the ![OpenITI corpus](http://kitab-project.org/docs/openITI#1-what-is-openiti). Saḥnūn was the most prominent Mālikī jurist of the Islamic West who liived in Qayrawān in 9th century CE, and the study of the Mudawwana is important for our understanding of the development of the Mālikī school of law. 





*The template was originally developed by Sohail Merchant, who also introduced me to PowerBI.
