# [First Five Hundred Years of the Arabic Book: The Native Origin of the Authors](https://kitab-project.org/b/)
What do we know about the authors of the earliest Arabic books in terms of their native origins and linguistic and cultural backgrounds? Were the majority of them Arabic-speaking Muslims from imperial capitals, or non-Arab converts or even non-Muslims? Could this information be useful in tracing the flow and formation of ideas and culture? To answer these questions computationally, one must begin with creating a corpus of texts – in this case the OpenITI – including robust metadata for the texts and their authors. In this blog post, I will discuss the question of the native origins of scholars and authors of early Islamicate society based on a subcorpus of the OpenITI, which includes all the texts in the corpus written within the first five centuries of Islam, ending in 505/1111, al-Ghazali’s death date. More generally, I hope to show how a combination of quantitative and macroanalytic approaches can be useful for the study of premodern Arabic texts and the history of the Arabic book and its authors.

# [Between Manuscripts and Digital Texts: Commentaries on Hadith Raʾs al-Jalut](https://kitab-project.org/Between-Manuscripts-and-Digital-Texts-Commentaries-on-Hadith-Ra%CA%BEs-al-Jalut/)
For us as digital historians and corpus curators, faced with the complex history of reception and transmission as well as the distinct approach to learning and authorship, attributing authors to premodern Islamicate texts and representing this complexity within our corpus metadata is often a challenging task. Although it is especially daunting for composite texts, commentaries, and supercommentaries, the task is no less challenging when it comes to working with printed editions and online digital libraries, since we face the risk of reproducing editorial choices and biases, whether knowingly or unknowingly.[read more](https://kitab-project.org/Between-Manuscripts-and-Digital-Texts-Commentaries-on-Hadith-Ra%CA%BEs-al-Jalut/)

# [Algorithmic Reading of Shiʿi Hadith Collections: Direct Borrowing and Common Sources](https://kitab-project.org/Algorithmic-Reading-of-Shi%CA%BFi-Hadith-Collections-Direct-Borrowing-and-Common-Sources/)
It is not accidental that a large number of books in the OpenITI corpus belong to one important genre, prophetic Hadith – the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad and accounts of his practice. As a repository of the prophetic tradition (sunna), they are considered an authoritative source of law and moral guidance in Islam. When early Muslim religious scholars sought ‘knowledge’ (ʿilm), they often meant Hadith. In this blog post, I will briefly discuss what Shiʿi Hadith is and provide some preliminary ideas towards reconstructing early Hadith transmission through computational reading.
